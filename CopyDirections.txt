There are a few steps in order to copy this bot for all possible units. Please make sure to follow each step carefully.

1. The only things you need to change are in Constants and Z_Units
2. If a comment says to not change the Constant, DO NOT CHANGE IT
3. For all comments that do not have a (No Change), you may change the constant to whatever you like
4. Add a question to specific units following the given unit example
5. If an AP Course does not have 10 units, it is ok. Do not delete the unit classes
6. Don't forget to add a .env file!!!
